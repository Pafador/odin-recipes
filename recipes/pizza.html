    <p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a popular dish of Italian origin, consisting of a round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough 
        topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, 
        pineapple, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. The dough is typically 
        flavored with olive oil, salt, and sometimes sugar. <em>Pizza is enjoyed worldwide and comes in numerous styles and 
        variations, with the Margherita pizza, topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and olive oil, 
        being one of the most classic and well-loved varieties.</em></p>
