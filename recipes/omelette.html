    <p>
        <strong>Spanish Omelette</strong>, also known as Tortilla Espa√±ola, is a traditional dish from Spain, primarily consisting of potatoes and eggs.<br>
        The basic version only includes these two ingredients, but it can also be made with additional ingredients like onions, garlic, and various herbs and spices.<br>
        The process involves thinly slicing the potatoes (and onions if using), frying them in olive oil, and then mixing them with beaten eggs.<br>
        The mixture is then cooked slowly on a low heat. Unlike most omelettes, the Spanish Omelette is often served cold and can be enjoyed as a tapa, or a light meal.<br>
        <em>The Spanish Omelette is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed at any time of day, and it's a beloved staple in Spanish cuisine.</em>
