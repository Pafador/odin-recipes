        <strong>Cheesecake</strong> is a sweet dessert that consists of one or more layers, with the main layer being a mixture of soft, fresh cheese, eggs, and sugar.<br>
        The bottom layer usually consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies, graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.<br>
        Cheesecakes can be prepared baked or unbaked, and are often flavored with vanilla, lemon, chocolate, or other flavors, and can be topped with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.<br>
        <em>Cheesecakes are enjoyed worldwide, with many regions having their own unique versions and flavors.</em>
